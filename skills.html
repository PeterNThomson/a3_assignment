        <h1>Skills & Jobs</h1>
        <p1>
          Many different roles and skills would be essential in the artifact creation of a Spotify overlay, 
          Let alone any large or small scale project. One of the leading roles would obviously be Software Engineer. 
          a lead software engineer designs, builds, and maintains machines and structures within the development team. 
          To do that, they apply the principles of software engineering. Additionally, they are responsible for the development,
          maintenance, testing, and software evaluation (What Does A Lead Software Engineer Do? | Full Scale, 2022).
          This being the lead role for the creation of such an artifact is the key component for commencement in such a project.
          In addition, moving forward onto a large-scale project of such, a team of trained individuals would be needed.
          Starting with management of some sort, a Project Manager or someone who can delegate set tasks to individuals of a team,
          so the workload does not seem so “sloppy” or “all over the place” as well as someone who is able to efficiently time manage
          to meet set due dates etc. A project manager is responsible for planning and overseeing projects within an organisation,
          from the initial ideation through to completion. They coordinate people and processes to deliver projects on time,
          within budget and with the desired outcomes aligned to objectives (Latest Project Manager Jobs | Hudson, 2022).
          A second software developer would also be needed, someone who is able to problem solve and diagnose as well as collaborate
          with the lead software developer, Software Developers have many different day-to-day responsibilities, such as creating efficient algorithms,
          producing clean code, integrating third-party programmes into systems, and identifying areas of improvement based on user feedback
          (Software Developer job description, 2022). 2 heads are always better then 1, especially working with code. As there are pull requests,
          on GITHUB for example, there is generally a team of up to 4 collaborators, each with individual set tasks for completion of an artifact of such,
          this helps towards end game completion of the workload. A graphic designer or Marketing coordinator would also be an essential team member as
          creation of such a design or model requires advertisement, this is also a key factor when getting your project out on the market as this will
          bring in a client base as well as get people interested or hyped in relation to what you may be selling or creating,
          whether it be subscription based or sold entirely to a 3rd party, design and advertisement is a must. 
          The combined team would work together in an office type setting or remotely from home, remembering collaboration is also a must when working on large,
          even small, scaled projects. </p1>
