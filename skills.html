        <h1>Lead Software Engineer:</h1>
        <p>
          The Lead Software Engineer is responsible for applying the principles
          of engineering to the development, maintenance, testing and software
          evaluation of the overlay. Experience in leading a small team to
          design, build and maintain the software is crucial. As the lead
          software role for this creation, this role is the key component for
          commencement in the project.
        </p>
        <h1>Computer Programmer:</h1>
        <p>
          Extensive knowledge of the Python language, as well as experience in a
          similar role using Python is needed for this job role. Not only will
          the selected employee be writing the code for the overlay, but also
          completing the tasks of testing the program, correcting coding errors,
          and reviewing and rewriting the program when needed. The successful
          candidate must have a proven record of submitting projects at the
          required deadline and alongside software developers and software
          engineers.

        <h1>Graphic Designer:</h1>
        <p>
          A Graphic Designer is an essential member of this team, in creating
          the aesthetic design of the overlay. Experience in creating similar
          designs for programs is necessary, along with innovative thinking, and
          working alongside a Project Manager is required to create the perfect
          look for the overlay.
        </p>
        <h1>Software Developer:</h1>
        <p>
          A Software Developer is needed to not only problem solve and diagnose,
          but also create efficient algorithms, integrate the Tekore Library
          into the overlay, and identify areas of improvement based on not only
          testing, but feedback from Beta users. Experience in innovative
          thinking, as well as working as a team alongside Software Engineers
          and Computer Programmers is essential in this job role, as well as
          having the ability to accept positive and negative feedback and move
          forward with necessary changes based on this feedback when needed.
