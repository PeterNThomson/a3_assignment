        <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
        <h3>Peter</h3>
        <p>
          This assignment period saw all group members having to deal with
          various life challenges thrown in the way, despite this fact we
          persevered and were able to produce an assignment that we were happy
          with, given the time constraints we encountered. Because of the we
          were unable to schedule regular meetings and as a result communication
          was lacking, we ended up defaulting back to Discord as a method of
          fast communication between group members because it is an application
          we are all familiar with, this was able to kickstart communication and
          get us back on the right track. In regard to GitHub commit trails for
          the website, as with last assignment it doesn't accurately display
          individual group members efforts towards our submission. We decided to
          delegate tasks out to align with everyone's strengths, while this
          approach diminished the ability for everyone to try their hand at
          something we didn't have a lot of experience in. But when life give
          you lemons, you make lemonade.

        <p>As for our group communications, we have a team of 5. 
          We have found the most beneficial way to communicate with one another
          whilst collaborating on assignment 3, has been to use what we all know best,
          that being discord. Discord is an instant messaging platform which is used
          vividly amongst gamers even collaborators. During our study’s with RMIT we
          have been frequently in contact with one another, even outside of study hours,
          we have a tight nit group of people who share similar interests making the
          procrastinators a reliable, enthusiastic group of people. We have really had no
          issues communication wise, as we are online almost every day, we have had a share
          of life circumstances which may have caused us to be delayed in our study, 
          however we have always been open and honest with one another,
          letting each other know what is going on in our personal lives so we don’t have mishaps etc.
          Again, working as a group, we found discord a more convenient way to talk to one another and
          schedule meetings, as opposed to Microsoft teams, Which speaking for myself, found a little frustrating. 
          We could have improved by using Microsoft Teams for meetings more so than Discord, to keep track of meetings. 
          I have learnt that groups are essential when working on a project, to evenly share the workload.
          I was suprised with my progress in commiting changes to Github, and how this has improved since the first assignment.
