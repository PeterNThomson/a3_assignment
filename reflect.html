        <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
        <h3>Peter</h3>

          This assignment period saw all group members having to deal with
          various life challenges thrown in the way, despite this fact we
          persevered and were able to produce an assignment that we were happy
          with, given the time constraints we encountered. Because of the we
          were unable to schedule regular meetings and as a result communication
          was lacking, we ended up defaulting back to Discord as a method of
          fast communication between group members because it is an application
          we are all familiar with, this was able to kickstart communication and
          get us back on the right track. In regard to GitHub commit trails for
          the website, as with last assignment it doesn't accurately display
          individual group members efforts towards our submission. We decided to
          delegate tasks out to align with everyone's strengths, while this
          approach diminished the ability for everyone to try their hand at
          something we didn't have a lot of experience in. But when life give
          you lemons, you make lemonade.

          It's been great working with such an efficient team of like-minded
          individuals. The group environment is lighthearted and fun; everyone
          is relaxed, and there's no stress over deadlines. Unfortunately,
          throughout this last assessment period, the majority of our group
          could not find a suitable time for group meetings. Work, in general,
          was difficult due to life getting in the way. This was our only
          weakness, and it's hard to say how we could improve it as it's almost
          entirely out of our control. Despite not having much time to complete
          our goals, I was surprised by how easily we could finish the work
          without any stress. After this experience, I've learned to trust my
          teammates; even when the going gets tough, I feel confident that we'll
          pull through.

          As for our group communications, we have a team of 5. We have found
          the most beneficial way to communicate with one another whilst
          collaborating on assignment 3, has been to use what we all know best,
          that being discord. Discord is an instant messaging platform which is
          used vividly amongst gamers even collaborators. During our study's
          with RMIT we have been frequently in contact with one another, even
          outside of study hours, we have a tight nit group of people who share
          similar interests making the procrastinators a reliable, enthusiastic
          group of people. We have really had no issues communication wise, as
          we are online almost every day, we have had a share of life
          circumstances which may have caused us to be delayed in our study,
          however we have always been open and honest with one another, letting
          each other know what is going on in our personal lives so we don't
          have mishaps etc. Again, working as a group, we found discord a more
          convenient way to talk to one another and schedule meetings, as
          opposed to Microsoft teams, Which speaking for myself, found a little
          frustrating. We could have improved by using Microsoft Teams for
          meetings more so than Discord, to keep track of meetings. I have
          learnt that groups are essential when working on a project, to evenly
          share the workload. I was suprised with my progress in commiting
          changes to Github, and how this has improved since the first
          assignment.

          At first I was a little anxious about going out to pick my own group
          to be a part of in this different environment, that being working with
          other people on a screen. Although instead of the doubts and fear that
          had surrounded me, I was welcomed to the enthusiasm and the
          determination of the members of my team for IT. We began to get to
          realise each person's interests on discord for two weeks that had
          assisted me open up to the team and result in making a good working
          environment that makes me want to go to greater length to study and to
          improve myself so that I can be of support to the team. Although we
          had many great meetings on MS Team we haven't used it all that much,
          another point is that as we were all getting to know each other, there
          could have been a few more agenda-based meetings in my opinion. All in
          all, I don't have a single bad thing to say, also I cannot wait to
          continue my studies with “The Procrastinators” as we have an amazing
          tight knit team of unique individuals who shared a lot of insight and
          loved to help one another along the way. This made for a fun and
          enthusiastic study environment in which everyone got along, I believe
          it doesn't get much better then that. I cannot wait to complete my
          study's with the team as well as progress with RMIT as I am learning
          so much as each day goes by.

          The biggest highlight for me in assessment 2 would have to be meeting
          other programmers/ IT peeps. I was comfortable being myself around
          this lot and found it quiet eye opening. it has made me realize just
          how wonderful and HUGE this industry really is, on top of that it has
          made me realize just how much more i need to push myself in this
          world. all of my group mates where so talented. However moving forward
          i believe we should focus more on the group meetings aspect where we
          lacked was communication on what we were going to do per meeting, we
          still got our work done but felt we could've been more active.(mainly
          myself) my current work life has managed to drag me down a bit. I am
          currently working 50 hours a week at a juvi where i do a mixture of
          Teacher aide work and basic IT duties. in the future i want to take a
          day off to study more and punch out future assessments, it would be
          such a big help for the team since i wouldn't be slowing them down as
          much. thank you team for being so supportive and thank you!,for
          reading this cant wait to show you what we "The Procrastinator's" are
          all about ;)... hopefully a little bit less procrastination from me.
