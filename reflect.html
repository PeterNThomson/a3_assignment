        <p>
          This assignment period saw all group members having to deal with
          various life challenges thrown in the way, despite this fact we
          persevered and were able to produce an assignment that we were happy
          with, given the time constraints we encountered. Because of the we
          were unable to schedule regular meetings and as a result communication
          was lacking, we ended up defaulting back to Discord as a method of
          fast communication between group members because it is an application
          we are all familiar with, this was able to kickstart communication and
          get us back on the right track. In regard to GitHub commit trails for
          the website, as with last assignment it doesn't accurately display
          individual group members efforts towards our submission. We decided to
          delegate tasks out to align with everyone's strengths, while this
          approach diminished the ability for everyone to try their hand at
          something we didn't have a lot of experience in. But when life give
          you lemons, you make lemonade.
