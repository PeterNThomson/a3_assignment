        <h1>The Procrastinator's</h1>
        <h2>Michael Ridgway - s3956710</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Michael Ridgway, I originate from New South Wales however
          now live on the beautiful Gold Coast, Queensland. I currently work as
          an Animal Attendant at a boarding kennel. My interest in IT started at
          the age of seven, compelled to learn all of the secrets and exploit
          bugs within a computer game, as well as play them for what they are on
          my parents good old Windows 94 computer with dial up Internet. Growing
          up, if I wasn't gaming, I was trying to fix all of the viruses and
          errors installed through my Limewire usage. Before starting this
          course, my knowledge in IT was self taught through gaming, Youtube,
          and general trial and errors. I am currently 28 years of age and
          cannot wait to see where this ever so expanding journey of IT takes me
          as it is a true passion of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          As my dream is to work in a tech company in gaming or as a software
          developer, my passion is still the same, as are my goals set in place
          to achieve what i am chasing. I dream of working in such a job role as
          it excites me and I am passionate about doing so. Working as a
          Software developer as such is something that has always sparked a
          flame in my life, I love talking about it, even working on all things
          related to doing so, I also find the hairs on the back of my neck
          stand up when talking about something i have such a passion for. So
          why wouldn't I persue something that, as opposed to feeling like a
          job, is more of a hobby that I get paid for! The older I get, the more
          I realise how precious and short life really is, so again, why not
          persue something that makes me happy, and potentially travel the world
          while doing so!.

        <h2>Peter Thomson - s3950560</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Peter Thomson, I was born and raised in Western Australia
          attending school in the city before moving outwards to the country. Up
          until this point in my life I have worked predominantly as a chef,
          with some positions allowing me to work and see some extremely remote
          and amazing areas of this country. My interest in IT mainly stems from
          a love of computer games and digital art with my experience generally
          centred around the same topics, general troubleshooting and the like
          when games or the pc in general spits out one of those wonderful
          errors they like to give from time to time. Since starting my studies
          through RMIT I have developed a stong interest in web
          design/development.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ideal job as outlined in assignment 1 and 2 to work at SpaceX as a
          software engineer is still something that is a passion and a driving
          force for me succeed in this course, and indeed the degree as a whole,
          then out into the industry. While I don't have a distinct career plan
          moving forward, it is my aim to hopefully move onto a job pathway out
          of university that will gain me the necessary skills in LabView
          programming, and object-oriented programming, as these are strongly
          desired skills for my ideal position as a software engineer. That
          being said, through this course so far, the exposure to the front-end
          development of HTML and CSS, I have found some questions starting to
          arise. I have genuinely enjoyed the creative side of using
          particularly CSS, far more than I had anticipated, this however, from
          the limited research I have done, is an incredibly competitive side of
          the IT industry. I look forward to seeing if these thoughts of aiming
          at a more front-end focused position, grow or subside the further I
          progress through this course.

        <h2>Alexander Sloan - s3923383</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Alexander Sloan; I live in a small country town in
          Victoria, Australia, where I work as a freelance video editor. Since
          the age of about five, I was glued to computer screens. Captured by
          this new avenue of creation, I began playing with 3D modelling using
          SketchUp and recording home videos on Photo Booth. At age 11, I found
          my first true passion-video editing. I would spend the next eight
          years teaching myself the ins and outs of video production and
          filmmaking, at some points working professionally, but mainly just as
          a hobby for my enjoyment. Today, I am 19 years old, and I believe I
          have found my second true passion- programming, and I can't wait to
          see where it takes me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ideal job is very fluid at the moment, as my primary pursuit in the
          IT industry is solely to learn and expand my abilities. For me,
          learning about IT and programming is more of a hobby or passion, so it
          would be reasonable to say that my ideal job is simply to work on my
          own projects. I have been working part-time on a personal Discord bot
          for the past six months, which has been surprisingly gratifying. It
          took a lot of trial and error, but I managed to break new ground and
          develop features that no other bot has. The experience has lit a fire
          in my heart to create innovative and exciting programs, and I'm happy
          to say that our project idea for this assessment is one of them.

        <h2>Alexios Angelopoulos - s3951526</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Alexios Angelopoulos although people call me Alex,
          apparently my student ID is s3951526 and student email is
          s3951526@student.rmit.edu.au. I was in a wheelchair since I was five
          years old with dystonia which is essentially makes it difficult to
          move that's effected the right side of my body, I'm Greek and Italian,
          although being born in Australia, i celebrate two easters. I had
          graduated from year 12 VCE last year and now studying online with open
          universities on introduction to Information Technology at RMIT. My
          hobbies are game that include strategy and card games, video games,
          puzzles, drawing, reading, lawn bowl, DJ which I do psycodelic and
          psycodelic trans or other stuff that interest me, I also have a dog
          named jojo.
        </p>
        <p>
          My ideal job is still going to be at Michael Page Information
          Technology or somewhere similar cause I feel as this position being a
          software engineer will give me more freedom a make stuff that the
          client wants to make this will enable me to find ways to solve issues
          that might appear and to achieve the product or a functions that the
          client is asking for and to learn stuff such as new programming
          language, figure out new ways to solve problems and to adapted to new
          situations as I carry out to make of what the client want with my
          expertise. The skill that are required for the position is
          interchangeable with other job position such as software developer
          which is Michael's position at patient zero and software developer
          which is Alexander's position at data processor, software engineer
          which is Peter's at space X, game developer which is Kian's position
          at studio iO where these positions use the similar NET, C#, scripting
          experience such as Python and other programming languages, I love to
          figure out ways to achieve a goal and to enrich my understanding.

        <h2>Kian Yuke Hill - s3950817</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Kian Yuke Hill, I live in a beach side town in QLD. Where I
          work as a Teacher aide/ Kind of a IT apprentice of sorts. From a very
          young age I have been addicted to technology whether that be the
          latest gaming system or even the old first gen ipods! My interest
          peaked when I realised I could utilise technology to help most people.
          I'm currently in the early stages of learning to upgrade a student
          data system in a government school. And on the side, I'm am still very
          addicted and fascinated in the world of video-games. I enjoy the
          thought of making a creative space where others can truly express
          their most artistic and creative selves. I'm 23 and only just
          realising this passion one day at a time. I can't wait to work in a
          team that focuses more on the enjoyment of the industry and less on
          the money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since my interest and dreams rely heavily on programming and
          understanding the fundamentals behind languages and how you can
          utilise them all together. I imagine I would be able to enjoy the
          video game programming life whilst still having a so called “safe job”
          like a data analysist. granted I've never been the one to choose the
          safer option. Working as a software developer has always been a big
          passion in my life and always will be… whether that is paid or free
          (for a hobby). It to me sounds just like the metaverse. It is vast
          open and wild and VERY open to an artistic touch. It is something that
          gets more enjoyable in time and if you can do something you love
          whilst making a buck then why not pursue it professionally. I like to
          think logically but I can't help staying in the gaming industry it
          interests me far too much. So why not live in the world of make
          believe!

        <h1>Group Process & Career Plans</h1>
        <p>
          As evident from our individual career aspirations, we all have fairly
          similar goals, all having a passion for going down the software
          engineer or game development route. Through discussion however we have
          talked about these goals very likely evolving as we progress through
          university and as we are exposed to different aspects of the IT
          industry. One thing is clear we all have a passion for technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group worked together extremely well through assignment 2, with
          all group members attending meetings and showing an all-around
          interest in the project. Moving into assignment 3 we aim to improve
          our meetings by keeping them to a more manageable time limit, to not
          be overwhelmed with too much information, as well as improving the way
          tasks are delegated amongst the team.
