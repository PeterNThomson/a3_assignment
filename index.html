            <h2>Michael Ridgway - s3956710</h2>
            <p>My name is Michael Ridgway, I originate from New South Wales however 
                now live on the beautiful Gold Coast, Queensland. I currently work 
                as an Animal Attendant at a boarding kennel. My interest in IT 
                started at the age of seven, compelled to learn all of the secrets 
                and exploit bugs within a computer game, as well as play them for 
                what they are on my parents good old Windows 94 computer with dial 
                up Internet. Growing up, if I wasn't gaming, I was trying to fix all 
                of the viruses and errors installed through my Limewire usage. 
                Before starting this course, my knowledge in IT was self taught 
                through gaming, Youtube, and general trial and errors. I am currently 
                28 years of age and cannot wait to see where this ever so expanding 
                journey of IT takes me as it is a true passion of mine.</p>
            <h2>Peter Thomson - s3950560</h2>
            <p>My name is Peter Thomson, I was born and raised in Western Australia 
                attending school in the city before moving outwards to the country. 
                Up until this point in my life I have worked predominantly as a chef, 
                with some positions allowing me to work and see some extremely remote 
                and amazing areas of this country. My interest in IT mainly stems 
                from a love of computer games and digital art with my experience 
                generally centred around the same topics, general troubleshooting and 
                the like when games or the pc in general spits out one of those 
                wonderful errors they like to give from time to time. Since starting 
                my studies through RMIT I have developed a stong interest in web 
                design/development.</p>
            <h2>Alexander Sloan - s3923383</h2>
            <p>My name is Alexander Sloan; I live in a small country town in Victoria, 
                Australia, where I work as a freelance video editor. Since the age of 
                about five, I was glued to computer screens. Captured by this new avenue 
                of creation, I began playing with 3D modelling using SketchUp and 
                recording home videos on Photo Booth. At age 11, I found my first true 
                passion-video editing. I would spend the next eight years teaching myself 
                the ins and outs of video production and filmmaking, at some points 
                working professionally, but mainly just as a hobby for my enjoyment. Today, 
                I am 19 years old, and I believe I have found my second true passion-
                programming, and I can't wait to see where it takes me.</p>

            <h2>Kian Yuke Hill - s3950817</h2>
            <p>My name is Kian Yuke Hill, I live in a beach side town in QLD. Where I work 
                as a Teacher aide/ Kind of a IT apprentice of sorts. From a very young age I 
                have been addicted to technology whether that be the latest gaming system or 
                even the old first gen ipods! My interest peaked when I realised I could 
                utilise technology to help most people. I'm currently in the early stages of 
                learning to upgrade a student data system in a government school. And on the 
                side, I'm am still very addicted and fascinated in the world of video-games. 
                I enjoy the thought of making a creative space where others can truly express 
                their most artistic and creative selves. I'm 23 and only just realising this 
                passion one day at a time. I can't wait to work in a team that focuses more 
                on the enjoyment of the industry and less on the money.</p>
