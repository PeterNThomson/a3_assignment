            <h1>The Procrastinator's</h1>
            <p>You will have submitted a Team Profile as part of Assignment 2. You can 
                use this as a basis for this Team Profile, noting anychanges in the group 
                as appropriate. There are some slight differences this time around, as noted below. <br><br>
                Team Name <br>
                You are free to choose any name for your group that you wish. However, this 
                name will be used to identify your group for the
                rest of the course, so please choose wisely. You should also keep in mind that 
                this name could be one that comes to the
                attention of potential employers. This is the same as in Assignment 2, so you 
                can reuse your work from there, unless you wish
                to make changes. <br><br>
                Personal information <br>
                One paragraph per person, including name, student number, background, hobbies, 
                IT interest and IT experience. This should
                also include your teamâ€™s chosen name. This is the same as in Assignment 2, 
                so you can reuse your work from there, unless you
                wish to make changes. <br><br>
                Group Processes <br>
                How well did your group work together in Assignment 2? Will you be introducing 
                any changes in process for Assignment 3?
                This is new for this assignment. <br><br>
                Career Plans <br>
                Compare and contrast the career plans, including ideal jobs, for each person 
                in the group. This may have changed due to
                feedback from Assignments 1 and 2. What common elements are there, if any? What 
                differentiates each position from the
                others, if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the 
                group? This is new for this assignment.</p>
