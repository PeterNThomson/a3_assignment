        <h1>Project</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Topic</h3>
        <p>
          We want to create the ultimate lightweight overlay for playing music
          on Spotify. <br />
          <br />
          The overlay will be bound to a hotkey that will bring up an
          informative minimalist window in the upper left corner of your screen.
          This window will have intuitive button-based controls that allow for
          rapid song selection and effortless volume adjustment, among other
          things—all without causing any disruption to your current focus.
          Application will also have in-built user stat tracking. Once
          installed, the program will launch as a background process on windows
          start-up and fully initialise when Spotify is open and playing. Since
          the goal is to be as unobtrusive as possible, this will have almost
          zero performance impact.
        </p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          Music is one of the common pleasures we all share, one way or another;
          almost everyone listens to music in some form. Today, Spotify alone
          has over 420 million users, with 44% of them listening to Spotify on a
          daily basis. Looking at Spotify's reported usage, we can estimate that
          over four million songs are streamed every minute, meaning over five
          billion songs are played every day. Despite Spotify being the most
          prominent music streaming platform, many users are unhappy with the
          application. One look at some of the top posts on the community Reddit
          board tells you that many users want to see changes and improvements
          made to the desktop client. <br /><br />
          Which made us think, could we make it better?
        </p>
        <h3>Landscape</h3>
        <p>
          Music overlays and products like this have very little presence in the
          current market. There are very few competing programs, and the ones
          available lack many of the core features and conveniences that
          Spotivenient provides. We believe this is due to the non-profit nature
          of these programs, and the amount of work required to build them..
          What sets our project apart from the others is our customizable
          display feature allowing users to be as minimalist as they want to be,
          and the most important difference is our user based stat tracking,
          along with the exciting things that are planned to work alongside this
          feature in the future. We believe that with the features we have, and
          the ideas being planned for the future we will be able to stay at the
          front of the pack, delivering a unique way to manage music streaming
          while on the grind.
        </p>
        <h2>Aims</h2>
        <p>
          The main aim of this project is to create the ultimate overlay for
          playing music on Spotify. Many PC users enjoy listening to music while
          working, studying, gaming or just simply browsing on a PC. While this
          can currently be done via playing music through Spotify, there is no
          option to change the playlist unless you reopen the tab. The aim of
          the project is to allow users to change their music choice, as well as
          adjust volume with the press of a button.<br />
          <br />

          The first goal is to make the program with the code, which is the most
          important part of the project, there is no project without the needed
          code. This part should have priority over the rest of the goals.
          Ensuring that the Tekore Library can be used with our coding language
          of Python allows us to move forward with the project.<br /><br />

          Another goal is to implement the code to be used within other
          applications, ensuring it can be used how we intend for it to be used,
          as well as ensuring that certain programs or games will allow the
          project to be used during gameplay/work. We need to ensure that our
          project can work under different PC applications firewalls.
          <br /><br />

          Finally, there is the goal of ensuring when pressing the needed
          buttons to control the overlay, that these do not interrupt with the
          users open application. Using keys that are not normally used by the
          everyday user can assist in this goal, allowing this to not be a major
          goal for the project.
        </p>

        <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
        <p>
          Given that our goal is to create a lightweight Spotify overlay this
          project doesn't contain a massive amount of features, it displays a
          small window at the top of the screen along with mappable hotkeys to
          adjust volume and change songs. We are also excited about the
          implementation of an expandable window that will contain user stat
          tracking, letting the user see how much music they have been listening
          to, most listened to genre or artist, songs and more, without having
          to wait for the once-a-year Spotify wrap up. Our core design goal from
          the start, was to create a lightweight, informative, and as
          unobtrusive as possible overlay, allowing user to flick through there
          Spotify library without losing focus on the task at hand, whilst
          having the option to display detailed statistics about their music
          listening history. <br /><br />
          At present our project is still in the very early development stage,
          we have developed a proof-of-concept animation to visually display the
          direction we are heading with our overlay. Below are some screenshots
          taken from said animation, to see full animation refer to our video
          presentation.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/full_size_mode.png" alt="" />
        <img src="assets/minimal_mode.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          But let's go back and talk about how we got here, and where we plan to
          go moving forward. <br />With all members of our group being avid
          music listeners through Spotify, along with the reported 180 million
          other Spotify subscribers, (Spotify users - subscribers in 2022 |
          Statista, 2022), not just users but paying customers worldwide, we
          felt that our frustrations, along with many of the growing concerns
          and frustrations around the applications clunky interface from users
          everywhere, was something worth spending time on to see if we could
          make an improvement. In line with our design philosophy, we sat down
          to discuss, “what is the bare minimum number of features we need for
          this overlay to function but remain lightweight?”. <br /><br />
          With this is mind we landed on the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>All actions must be hotkey mappable</li>
          <li>Pause/play</li>
          <li>Cycle through library or playlist tracks</li>
          <li>Volume adjustment</li>
          <li>Ability to scrub through tracks</li>
          <li>User statistics</li>
          <li>Minimalistic visual display of the information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While it was tempting to get carried away here adding more and more
          features, we opted to stay with a smaller more achievable goal that
          left room for expansion in the future. <br />
          <br />
          When it came down to deciding what software and programming was going
          to be needed to implement our features in the way we had envisioned,
          and given the group relatively novice level of knowledge around
          programming languages, we anticipate this list is likely going to be
          added to as the project moves forward. We decided to use Python as our
          language of choice as some of the group had some proficiency in it,
          along with a few libraries being, Tekore, pygame, tkinter and pywin32.
          We believe this set of libraries will cover the implementation of the
          features we are after, but again we are prepared for this to change as
          the project evolve, and are confident we can overcome these obstacles.
          <br />
          <br />
          Given our limited knowledge around the backend side of things we opted
          for focusing on the frontend design before diving into the coding
          portion of the overlay. Doing so has allowed us to create a first
          visual mock-up of the design giving a solid foundation to build upon
          visually and a clear target to pursue. Which brings us back to the
          present stage of the project, so what's next? <br />
          <br />
          One section has been alluded to, but not shown, user statistics. This
          feature was a late addition to the project, but one that we felt had a
          place within our application, while not a tool that is for everyone,
          having the ability to track listening hours or what genre/artist those
          hours were spent on, was something that got our team excited. Bunch of
          statistic nerds. This will likely be our next course of action, to
          design a simplistic expandable window for displaying user statistics
          that still holds true to our original design goals, after this we move
          into the coding phase. <br />
          <br />
          Coding will undoubtedly be the lengthiest phase of the project, due to
          inexperience there will be quite the learning curve as we move through
          integrating the various features into an application. But as stated
          earlier we are confident that with some experimentation and practise,
          we can overcome these hurdles to create an eye-pleasing, more
          productive, streamlined solution to alt-tabbing away from work to
          handle music. <br />
          <br />
          Some of the features that arose throughout the planning process were a
          leader board system working alongside user statistics to compete with
          friends, variant style options for the overlay itself beyond the
          default options like border style options or complete themes. While we
          are excited to look further into these features, this would be
          reserved for future versions of the application as these types of
          features generally are used by fairly niche portion of the population.
        </p>
        <h2>Roles</h2>
        <p>
          We have not defined specific roles in our group, being all new to the
          field of IT we felt it better to all remain the same hat to better our
          collective knowledge across every aspect of the project. While there
          were no defined roles, all group members held certain strengths, with
          task delegation being handled by assigning jobs to those had the most
          confidence in the given task. Working this way allowed better
          communication between group members, as well as the ability to learn
          from one another in area's that group members hadn't been exposed to
          before, it also fostered a healthy environment for discussing topics
          none of us were fluent in, brainstorming, bouncing idea around and
          learning together.
        </p>
        <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
        <p>
          The priority of the project is to produce our Spotify Overlay using
          the Tekore Library, along with our chosen coding language Python. The
          scope includes the overlay that works with keys on all keyboards,
          allowing the user to switch songs and playlists whenever suits them,
          that works on all major PC applications, including Microsoft
          applications, internet browsers, emails etc. The limits include the
          mentioned feature of user statistics, as well as a leader board system
          that works alongside other users. Neither of these are priorities in
          the alluded time frame for the project.
        </p>
        <h2>Tools and Technology</h2>
        <p>The software we will be using for this project is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Visual Studio Code v1.67 (IDE)</li>
          <li>Python v3 (Language)</li>
          <li>Tekore (Software Library)</li>
          <li>PyQt (Software Library)</li>
          <li>Adobe Creative Cloud (Subscription)</li>
          <li>Adobe Photoshop v23.3 (Included with Creative Cloud)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          (No hardware is required) <br /><br />Alexander and Peter have prior
          experience with Visual Studio Code, Python, and Photoshop
        </p>
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Testing and debugging our program is one of our core focuses. We want
          to ensure that new features always work as intended and don't harm the
          program's stability. We will thoroughly test all changes locally
          before committing them to the main branch, especially in the early
          stages of development. We will perform the tests in a practical
          manner, using real Spotify accounts to be as accurate to natural
          conditions as possible. By testing every change and addition to our
          codebase, we will reveal problems right as they occur and saves us
          from debugging large amounts of code to figure out where the issue is
          coming from. When we can run all program features as intended without
          errors, we will know the change has been successfully implemented.

        <h2>Risks</h2>
        <p>
          Most of the risks for our overlay project are those surrounding the
          software required to build the application. As we are using multiple
          python associated libraries, there is a definite risk of these
          libraries not being able to fulfil the requirements that is needed to
          complete this project. There is also a risk of becoming obsolete due
          to constantly evolving hardware, in particular keyboards, as a lot of
          these products feature built-in keys for pause/play, skipping tracks
          and volume controls, rendering the need for additional keybinds moot.
          The overlay GUI itself to visibly see current track choice is also at
          risk of being made obsolete, given the general demographic of people
          that would be interested in such an overlay is gamers/heavy IT users,
          it is very commonplace now to have multiple displays, this coupled
          with in-built options on keyboards might see this project fall short
          of our anticipated need. (Keychron K2 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard
          (Version 2), 2022)

        <h2>Group Processes</h2>
        <p>
          As the group is all over Australia, communications are held via video
          meetings with Microsoft Teams twice a week for updates on the project.
          Communications have also been held through Discord, in which a team
          chat has been set up, and this is what is used to ask one another
          questions on process, assist each other with each task, and ensure
          everyone is okay and able to complete the requirements. Discord is not
          a requirement; however, the video meetings twice weekly are. If a
          group member does not respond to communications through Microsoft
          Teams and Discord, we all have each other's university emails, private
          emails and mobile phone numbers to ensure everything is okay.
